Title: Quantum-Enhanced Solar Cell with Perovskite Nanocrystals

Inventor: Dr. James Kim
Date: September 13, 2025

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to photovoltaic devices, specifically quantum dot solar cells utilizing perovskite nanocrystals for enhanced light absorption and energy conversion efficiency.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Traditional silicon solar cells have efficiency limits around 26% due to thermalization losses and inability to utilize the full solar spectrum. Perovskite solar cells show promise but suffer from stability issues and limited spectral range optimization.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention combines quantum-confined perovskite nanocrystals with multi-junction architecture to achieve 45% efficiency by capturing and converting previously wasted photon energy across the entire solar spectrum.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

1. NANOCRYSTAL STRUCTURE
- Size-tuned CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (2-8 nm diameter)
- Bandgap engineering from 1.2-2.4 eV through quantum confinement
- Ligand passivation with oleic acid prevents aggregation and degradation
- Self-assembled monolayer formation enables charge transport

2. MULTI-JUNCTION ARCHITECTURE
- Four spectral-matched subcells: UV (2.4 eV), visible (1.8 eV), NIR (1.4 eV), IR (1.0 eV)
- Transparent conducting oxide interlayers for current matching
- Anti-reflective coating optimized for 300-1200 nm wavelength range
- Concentrated photovoltaic design with 100x solar concentration

3. FABRICATION PROCESS
- Hot-injection synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals at 180°C
- Layer-by-layer deposition using spin-coating and ligand exchange
- Low-temperature annealing at 100°C preserves quantum confinement
- Encapsulation with UV-stable polymer prevents degradation

NOVELTY AND TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES
1. First use of quantum-confined perovskites in multi-junction solar cells
2. Achieves 45% efficiency vs 26% for silicon cells
3. Stable operation for 25+ years through encapsulation innovation
4. Cost-competitive at $0.05/Wp manufacturing cost

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
Applications include utility-scale solar farms, concentrated solar power systems, and space photovoltaics. Market size: $150B solar industry with premium efficiency segment.

COMPARISON TO PRIOR ART
Advantages over GaAs multi-junction cells:
- 10x lower material costs using earth-abundant elements
- Solution-processable vs expensive epitaxial growth
- Tunable bandgaps vs fixed III-V semiconductor properties
