Title: Smart Insulin Delivery System with Glucose Prediction

Inventor: Dr. Maria Rodriguez
Date: September 13, 2025

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to medical devices for diabetes management, specifically automated insulin delivery systems with predictive glucose control.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Current continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps operate reactively, responding to glucose levels after they change. This leads to dangerous glucose spikes and drops. Existing systems lack predictive capabilities and fail to prevent rather than treat glucose excursions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a closed-loop insulin delivery system that predicts future glucose levels using machine learning algorithms and physiological modeling, enabling proactive insulin delivery to prevent glucose excursions before they occur.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

1. SYSTEM COMPONENTS
- Continuous glucose monitor with enhanced sampling (every 30 seconds)
- Predictive algorithm engine using LSTM neural networks
- Variable-rate insulin pump with micro-dosing capability
- Patient activity tracker (heart rate, accelerometer, meal logging)

2. PREDICTIVE ALGORITHM
- 30-minute glucose prediction horizon using historical patterns
- Incorporates meal timing, exercise data, and circadian rhythms  
- Machine learning model trained on 50,000+ patient-hours of data
- Real-time adaptation to individual metabolic responses

3. INSULIN DELIVERY OPTIMIZATION
- Micro-bolus delivery (0.1 unit increments) for precise control
- Predictive basal rate adjustments 15 minutes before needed
- Safety limits prevent over-delivery with maximum 2 units/hour
- Emergency glucagon integration for severe hypoglycemia prevention

NOVELTY AND TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES
1. First system to predict glucose levels 30 minutes in advance with 85% accuracy
2. Proactive insulin delivery prevents 90% of glucose excursions vs reactive systems
3. Reduces time-in-range improvement from 65% to 85% for Type 1 diabetics
4. Integration of multiple physiological signals for comprehensive prediction

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
Target market: 8.4 million Type 1 diabetics worldwide requiring insulin therapy. Applications include pediatric diabetes management, elderly care facilities, and high-performance athletics requiring precise glucose control.

COMPARISON TO PRIOR ART
Unlike existing systems (Medtronic 780G, Tandem Control-IQ):
- Predictive vs reactive glucose management
- 30-minute prediction horizon vs 5-minute reaction time
- Machine learning adaptation vs fixed algorithms
