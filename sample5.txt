Title: Modular Vertical Farm Pod System

Inventor: Sarah Thompson  
Date: September 13, 2025

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to agricultural systems, specifically modular vertical farming structures for urban food production.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Urban agriculture faces space constraints and high setup costs. Current vertical farms are expensive, fixed installations requiring specialized buildings. Small-scale solutions lack efficiency while large systems are inaccessible to most farmers.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides stackable farming pods that can be deployed in parking lots, rooftops, or warehouses. Each pod is self-contained with hydroponics, LED lighting, and climate control, allowing modular expansion based on demand.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

1. POD STRUCTURE
- 8' x 8' x 10' aluminum frame modules weighing 500 lbs each
- Stackable up to 6 high using integrated locking mechanisms
- Weather-resistant polycarbonate panels with R-8 insulation
- Built-in water collection and recycling system

2. GROWING SYSTEM
- 96 plant sites per pod using NFT (Nutrient Film Technique)
- Full spectrum LED arrays consuming 400W per pod
- Automated nutrient dosing with pH and EC monitoring
- Vertical growing towers maximize space utilization

3. CONTROL SYSTEM
- IoT sensors monitor temperature, humidity, CO2, light levels
- Mobile app allows remote monitoring and control
- Automated harvesting alerts based on plant growth data
- Solar panel integration reduces grid electricity by 60%

NOVELTY AND TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES
- First truly modular vertical farm system deployable anywhere
- 40x higher yield per square foot than traditional farming
- $5,000 per pod cost vs $500,000 for fixed vertical farms
- Payback period of 18 months through premium crop pricing

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
Target customers include urban farmers, restaurants seeking local sourcing, and food service companies. Suitable for leafy greens, herbs, and small fruit production.

COMPARISON TO PRIOR ART
Unlike existing vertical farms:
- Modular vs fixed installation
- Portable vs permanent structure  
- Low cost vs high capital investment
