Title: Self-Folding Laundry Robot with Fabric Recognition

Inventor: David Chen
Date: September 13, 2025

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to household robotics, specifically automated laundry folding systems using computer vision and robotic manipulation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Folding laundry is time-consuming and repetitive. Existing laundry robots are limited to simple items and cannot handle diverse fabric types, sizes, or wrinkled clothing. Current systems require pre-sorting and fail with complex garments.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a robotic system that identifies clothing types using computer vision, handles wrinkled fabrics with steam preprocessing, and folds items using adaptive manipulation algorithms based on garment geometry.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

1. VISION SYSTEM
- 4K RGB-D cameras capture clothing from multiple angles
- CNN-based fabric classification (cotton, polyester, silk, denim, etc.)
- Wrinkle detection algorithm using texture analysis
- Size estimation through 3D point cloud processing

2. MANIPULATION SYSTEM  
- Dual-arm robot with 7 DOF per arm for complex movements
- Soft gripper fingers adapt to fabric thickness and texture
- Force feedback prevents tearing delicate materials
- Steam jets integrated in work surface for wrinkle removal

3. FOLDING ALGORITHMS
- Garment-specific folding patterns for shirts, pants, towels, sheets
- Adaptive folding based on fabric stiffness and size variations
- Edge detection and corner identification for precise alignment
- Quality assessment ensures consistent fold geometry

NOVELTY AND TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES
1. First robot to handle wrinkled and diverse fabric types automatically
2. 85% success rate across 20+ garment categories
3. 3 minutes average folding time per item vs 30 seconds manual
4. Integrated steam system eliminates need for pre-processing

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
Target markets include residential consumers, commercial laundromats, and hotel housekeeping services. Estimated market: $2B household robotics segment.

COMPARISON TO PRIOR ART
Unlike existing folding robots (FoldiMate, Laundroid):
- Handles wrinkled fabrics vs only smooth items
- No pre-sorting required vs manual categorization
- Adapts to garment variations vs fixed size requirements
